## 4. Dropshipping: Start an E-Commerce Business Without Inventory

Dropshipping is an e-commerce model that allows you to sell products without holding inventory. You simply create an online store, and when a customer orders, the supplier ships the product directly to them.

### Tools to Get Started:
- **Shopify**
- **Oberlo**
- **Spocket**

### Key Advantages:
- **Low startup costs.**
- **Ability to test various niches.**
- **Scalable income potential.**

However, success in dropshipping requires effective marketing and niche research, so be prepared to invest time in learning.

### Benefits:
- **Set your own schedule.**
- **Get paid quickly, often within a week.**
- **No specialized skills are required.**

While this side hustle offers steady income, factor in expenses like fuel, maintenance, and insurance before getting started.
